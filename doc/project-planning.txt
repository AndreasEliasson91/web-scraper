=== Job Portal Scrapper ===

Base Idea:
    Web Scrapper to crawl and scrap job portals and search for job adverts based on keywords

Stages:
    - Start with "monster.se" and scrap the front page for info (Just to see if the algo works)
    - Add a keyword and a location, and scrap the first advert page
    - Move to the next page, WHILE new_page: -> Scrap; else: -> Add info to csv
    - Set up a .bat-script that runs daily

Info to scrap and save:
    - Job title
    - location
    - URL
    - Requirments (add later)

Pages to scrap:
    - monster
    - indeed
    - linkedin
    - arbetsf√∂rmedlingen

# Save file gets name from scrap-date, keyword and URL, ex. PYTHON_MONSTER-SE_2023-07-12.csv etc.
